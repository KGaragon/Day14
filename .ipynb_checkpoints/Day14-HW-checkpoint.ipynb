    "**Q1** In my opinion, algorithms are not always good because many times you search for something in one application and what you searched for appears in another. Many other times you are talking, and the application shows exactly what you were talking about. Personally, I don't like this algorithm because it is something that I didn't ask for. I know that I probably gave permission by accepting the cookies, but I don't like it. There is also another type of algorithm that is used to make a decision, and although the algorithm can be a good thing because it analyzes large data, algorithms are not so good because they can create false answers, in the way that people can just use those algorithms without even investigating further, since algorithms are not something created by humans."

Another way to prepare yourself is to not rely 100% on technology, because even though it can give good insight, it is not always right, and we should not let technology block our human judgment."

    "**Q3** I believe the first step should be to comprehend the context and the reasons behind someone's bias. Because their opinion may make sense to them and may come from different experiences. But ultimately I think the best thing to do is to inform that person of your opinion and that you think that person is not putting forward their neutral opinions and that maybe they are feeling a little biased towards something. This is an important thing to do because if you don't do it and sugarcoat your opinion, it can hurt the person; you have to give honest feedback. But above all, the important thing is to do it in an appropriate way, showing empathy and respect, so as not to cause problems or awkward moments. You have to show the person that even though their information looks good, you think that maybe they are not being completely neutral.\n"

    "This article talks about the use of artificial intelligence and the use of technology. It talks about how it benefits humans by reducing jobs that intelligence can do. At the same time, the reduction of human labor causes a lot of panic. The ideal is to create a balance between human and technological labor, because otherwise, having more technology than human labor could be fatal and also reduce the opportunities for human life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article talks about the importance of balancing human activity with technology. Data ethics is about fixing these problems. Data ethics has three different branches; one of them is the ethics of data, which analyzes how large amounts of data should be used, which should be in a correct way, and respecting people, it should be used in a moral way. It seeks to ensure that no one's privacy is violated and that information is not used without consent. Another branch would be the ethics of algorithms, which deals with moral problems that come with artificial intelligence, since algorithms are becoming more and more intelligent and can make decisions on their own without human intervention, and that can cause many conflicts. The last branch, ethics of practices, deals with taking care of information and being responsible with it. As you can see, the three branches are very closely linked since they deal with the same thing. This was interesting because I read about data ethics in different fields, such as the medical field.\n",
